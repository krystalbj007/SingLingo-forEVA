[00:00.11] Remember me though I have to say goodbye
[00:06.75] Remember me, don't let it make you cry
[00:13.15] For even if I'm far away, I hold you in my heart
[00:18.63] I sing a secret song to you each night we are apart
[00:25.48] Remember me though I have to travel far
[00:31.94] Remember me each time you hear a sad guitar
[00:38.79] Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be
[00:46.62] Until you're in my arms again
[00:53.15] Remember me
[01:00.79]
